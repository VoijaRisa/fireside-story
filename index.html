    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>The young page startled from sleep as an armor stand crashed over.</p>
    <p><em>This is why I shouldn't let the damn cat in my room at night</em>, he thought to himself.</p>
    <p>Nervously he tossed back the blankets and shivered as the chilly air hit his flimsy shift.</p>
    <p>He stepped from the bed. As his feet hit the cold stone floor a hand snaked out from beneath the bed.</p>
    <p>It seized his ankle, pulling his legs from beneath him.</p>
